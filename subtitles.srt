00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Over the past two years, youth unemployment has been on the rise

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It currently represents just under 40% of all unemployment in Australia

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Young graduates leaving the university and finding it more and more difficult to enter any form of creative industry

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now, the common stipulation is that you can't get a job without experience, but you can't get a job to get the experience

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Now, meanwhile, 42% of small businesses failed in 2003 to 2007, and the figures haven't improved much

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:60,000
Amongst many reasons this is happening is a consistent lack of quality in their branding, marketing, websites and designs

7
00:00:60,000 --> 00:00:70,000
The kind of training that these graduates have just spent three to six years training for

8
00:00:70,000 --> 00:00:80,000
Now, what if there was an enterprise that bridged these two sets of frightening statistics? I want to build that bridge

00:00:80,000 --> 00:00:90,000
